To see the old year out and a hopefully much better 2022 in, a quick reminder on two points:

1. a recent decision in the *Scottish Borders Council* shows that 20mph can work and is popular![^1]

2. to let your councillors know what you think (hopes as well as concerns...)


## What about the Scottish Borders?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Scottish Borders Council agree by 26-5 to keep the 20mph limits set throughout communities after very positive speed reduction outcomes. <a href="https://t.co/i4VZorNDDO">pic.twitter.com/i4VZorNDDO</a></p>&mdash; Rod King MBE 30kmh/20mph limit champion (@20splentyforus) <a href="https://twitter.com/20splentyforus/status/1471473309967659008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## How to write to the council

There is a [Transport & Environment committee](https://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/dms/Committees/tabid/62/ctl/ViewCMIS_CommitteeDetails/mid/381/id/536/Default.aspx) meeting coming up in the new year (5 January). 

I wrote [a post on how you can get in touch with them](https://schluppeck.github.io/make-wb-20mph/2021/11/26/letter-to-transport-and-environment-committee/). Back in October I wrote to Neil Clarke, MBE, and received a very detailed and thoughtful reply! 

Clearly, that committee has a lot of difficult decisions to make and it was interesting to hear some perspectives from someone who represents a more rural area.

## and finally...

Merry christmas and have a good start into the new year!

[^1]: the [Scottish Borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Borders) is obviously not Nottingham, if that comparison worries you, but it contains Edinburgh (a city) and is comparable in population to Rushcliffe, but quite a bit larger in area. The interesting thing is that there was large support for 20mph in population and that the decision was also supported by a large majority in the council.
