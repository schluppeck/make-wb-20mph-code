Two quick questions to make you think about your driving habits. It's been many years for most of us since we had to answer them for a driving test...

<h2>Stopping distances...</h2>
<details>
<summary>What's the typical stopping distance for a car travelling at 30mph?</summary>
<b>6 car lengths, about 23m.</b> Before most people can react and start hitting the breaks, the car has travelled about 10m<br><br>
A car hitting a pedestrian at 27mph is equivalent to falling out out a 3rd story window. That means a 1 in 5 change of being killed, according to <a href="https://www.brake.org.uk/get-involved/take-action/mybrake/knowledge-centre/speed/speed-and-injury" target=_new>sources on the Brake website</a> <br>br>

<h2>Kinetic engery</h2>

<details>
<summary>How much more energy does a car travelleing at 30mph have than one at 20mph? 10%, (30-20)/20=50%, or 100%?</summary>
A crash at 30mph involves <b>twice as much</b> energy as one at 20mph! So, 100%. Reducing your speed that bit really helps a lot!<br><br>

</details>

That's all for now...
