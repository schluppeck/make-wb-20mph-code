## Wow! Even `stats19` data paints picture that's far too rosy

An [article in the Sunday Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/speeding-causes-three-times-as-many-road-deaths-as-previously-thought-8xbvp6d0q) describes how accident data from the scene of collisions drastically underestimates the effects of speeding.

*"If the rest of the country follows the same patterns as London and Manchester then there would be an **increase in speed being a contributory factor in road deaths by about three times**.‚Äù*, according to Detective Chief Superintendent Andy Cox (Lincolnshire police, national lead for fatal collision investigation).

The Sunday Times article reports that the number of cases with *speeding* as a factor had to be revised up from about 15% to nearly 50% after investigations were properly concluded (for the year 2020). This makes very clear how dangerous driving too fast actually is. 

**20 is plenty!**.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This confirms what we have said for years. Speed IS the reason why so many incidents turn into crashes and it increases severity of casualties. Speed takes away the space and time to avoid collisions. More reason that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/20splenty?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#20splenty</a> where people are. <a href="https://t.co/BSgIgNyrps">https://t.co/BSgIgNyrps</a></p>&mdash; Rod King MBE 30kmh/20mph limit champion (@20splentyforus) <a href="https://twitter.com/20splentyforus/status/1525715654565052417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Here is to hoping that [Nottinghamshire County Council](https://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/) will take this into account when developing their transport strategy further, especially with the motion to explore a 20mph speed limit in residential areas, which found cross-party support.
