## many items on Notts CC agenda

... which means that the petition (and motion) to consider 20mph default speed limit couldn't be discussed. Tweet from Cllr Penny Gowland:


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Still didn&#39;t get to discuss 20s plenty <a href="https://twitter.com/schluppeck?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@schluppeck</a> .. 4th time lucky</p>&mdash; Penny Gowland (@Penny_Gowland) <a href="https://twitter.com/Penny_Gowland/status/1463958750520348679?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But things don't happen instantly - and so I have decided to be constructive with the extra time and to write to the <a href="https://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/dms/Committees/tabid/62/ctl/ViewCMIS_CommitteeDetails/mid/381/id/536/Default.aspx">Transport & Environment Committee</a> of the Nottinghamshire CC in the meantime. Their next meeting is early in 2022 (5 Jan) and I thought it would be great to find out their views in the run-up to that meeting and the next full council meeting...
