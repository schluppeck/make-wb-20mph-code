On the morning of 11 October I decided to write a public facebook post about making West Bridgford a 20mph zone. The aim would be to lower the speed limit on residential roads from 30mph to 20mph.

The arguments in favour are simple:

- **safety** there are many, many children on the road (pedestrians and cyclists) at all times of day and 20mph is much safer

- **environment**, both in terms of emissions and how people not in cars can make use of the roads

There are also concerns about what introducing 20mph would mean:

- maybe it will just move the problem elsewhere and create traffic jams on larger roads

- maybe no-one will stick to the new limits, etc.

To gauge what people think and to have more information to take the *Nottinghamshire County Council* for a petition for this change, I decided to ask people to send me their thoughts.
