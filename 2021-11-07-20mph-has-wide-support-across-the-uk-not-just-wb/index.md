More than 70% of people in Britain support 20mph speed limits.[^1] There are many benefits, but three big ones are that it is 
- **healthier**... by encouraging people to hop on the bike or walk on more friendly roads
- **safer**... larger speeds = more accidents and more serious injury
- **cleaner**... there is much less pollution at slower speeds, particularly for stop-and-go accelerating as is common in residential areas

## People in NG support it

There are plenty of places across the UK that are campaigning for 20mph and many, like Nottingham City[^2], have decided to go for it. Interestingly, for the Nottingham crowd, support for 20mph in the city centre was **71%** - very much in line with UK-wide numbers. 

It is hard to imagine support would be any less in West Bridgford and other parts of Nottinghamshire.

## There are many campaigns across the UK (and beyond)
