Together with my original facebook post, I put together a [very short survey](https://forms.gle/TigMEgcqZXq5vApm7) and asked the following questions:

1. "What do you think about making the speed limit on all residential roads in WB 20mph?"

2. "Any other ideas / comments / questions?"

3. "Your e-mail address (optional)" - for letting people know what I found out.

An important caveat here is that this is not a scientific poll and just because there are lots of positive views expressed here doesn't necessarily mean that the same proportion of people in all of WB feel this way.

Nevertheless, I think it's clear that there is a **strong** desire for some change.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(janitor)
library(kableExtra)

# enable rendering from within RStudio console
# where getwd() is different that in rendering context
if ("data" %in% list.files()) {
  pathvar = "./"
} else {
  pathvar = "../../../"
}

d <- readxl::read_excel(str_c(pathvar, "data/make-wb-20mph-spreadsheet.xlsx")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(in_favour = starts_with("what_do_you"),
         other_thoughts = starts_with("any_other")) %>% 
  select(-1, -last_col())
  
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

## Summary

As of today (2021-10-15), 36 people filled in the form.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = for_against, fill = for_against)) + 
  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_brewer() +
  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat="count", nudge_y = -2 ) +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 0.5) +
  labs(y = NULL, x = NULL, title = "20mph in WB?") +
  coord_flip() 
    
```


Reading through the comments a couple of things stand out from the responses:

- **enforcement** is felt to be a huge issue.
- there are several place across WB that cause people issues
- **speeding is not the only issue**. it sounds like cars run pedestrian crossings all the time. not cool.
- **speed bumps** may be a bad idea (bad for buses, cars, may encourage speeding between bumps...)

Note: there are some cogent arguments against introducing blanket 20mph. Some of them are expressed in one of the **against** entries. But unfortunately, there is also a favourite "toys-out-of-the-pram" entry in the **against** bracket: 

>Teach your kids to cross the road properly if youâ€™re worried. 

Anonymous of course. Maybe what they meant was for there to be "more education on road safety at home and at school"?. But clearly, some people have deep-seated issues they need to resolve.
