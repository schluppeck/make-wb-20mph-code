<p>Together with my original facebook post, I put together a <a href="https://forms.gle/TigMEgcqZXq5vApm7">very short survey</a> and asked the following questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>“What do you think about making the speed limit on all residential roads in WB 20mph?”</p></li>
<li><p>“Any other ideas / comments / questions?”</p></li>
<li><p>“Your e-mail address (optional)” - for letting people know what I found out.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>An important caveat here is that this is not a scientific poll and just because there are lots of positive views expressed here doesn’t necessarily mean that the same proportion of people in all of WB feel this way.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think it’s clear that there is a <strong>strong</strong> desire for some change.</p>
<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>As of today (2021-10-15), 36 people filled in the form.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Reading through the comments a couple of things stand out from the responses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>enforcement</strong> is felt to be a huge issue.</li>
<li>there are several place across WB that cause people issues</li>
<li><strong>speeding is not the only issue</strong>. it sounds like cars run pedestrian crossings all the time. not cool.</li>
<li><strong>speed bumps</strong> may be a bad idea (bad for buses, cars, may encourage speeding between bumps…)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: there are some cogent arguments against introducing blanket 20mph. Some of them are expressed in one of the <strong>against</strong> entries. But unfortunately, there is also a favourite “toys-out-of-the-pram” entry in the <strong>against</strong> bracket:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Teach your kids to cross the road properly if you’re worried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anonymous of course. Maybe what they meant was for there to be “more education on road safety at home and at school”?. But clearly, some people have deep-seated issues they need to resolve.</p>

Think this is a great idea. The roads in WB are more congested than ever before and parked cars add to the problem. The crossings on Rectory road, Melton road and Bridgford road are becoming unsafe due to people driving too fast to notice people at the crossing or to stop in time. Musters road becomes more dangerous every year with the increased traffic flow, parked cars and people exceeding the speed limit because it is a smooth wide road

I absolutely support this and would like to see it happen. The roads are for everyone, not just for drivers. If we are really to encourage active travel for all, then residential streets must be 20, with protected active travel routes on all roads above 20mph

I live on Holme Road and people speed all the time. It’s narrow and there are several entrances to and from the park from which children run/skateboard out of. This road needs speed bumps due to its length. Cars can get up to 60mph on this road..
Also many people turn left as they leave the rugby club/sports bar from trent boulevard onto Radcliffe Road. Last time I counted 7 cars turning one after the other straight onto the green man pedestrian crossing. It’s so dangerous!

Loughborough Road and Melton Road on either side of Victoria Road should also have a speed flash light. I live on Elm Tree Avenue and have to cross both of these roads daily for school drop off/pick up. Daily cars are travelling more than 30mph. This is especially dangerous around the corner on George road/Melton Road. We walk up George road and there are always cars &amp; vans parked on both sides all the way up making crossing with children/bikes/prams dangerous. 20mph limit would be a far better limit for area. Giving reassurance to pedestrians, especially as there are many families in West Bridgford. With little inconvenience to drivers (to which I am also one).

Mobile Police enforcement cameras. I think it would be quite telling if the police patrolled the area for a period to see how bad the issue is. Also dangerous parking makes crossing roads unsafe, as visibility is poor. I think the permit area needs extending as it is mostly workers that park dangerously on abbey road, Davis road and Blake road which exacerbates the issues surrounded crossing roads safely. Especially so close to schools

Other aspects of the streetscape could encourage drivers to stick to this without speed cameras. This includes raised areas at the start and end of each residential street, clear and attractive signposting (not necessarily highway standard signs, but rather neighbourhood signs). Drivers (and I am one of them!) should realise they are a rather large and potentially dangerous guest on a street where people live and play.

Just wondering if this is really necessary. What evidence is there to back up a 20mph speed limit, how many Road Traffic Collisions have there been in West Bridgford over the past 2 years, how many were damage only How many were injury or non injury and how many fatalities, and what time of day. All these details are held at County Hall Traffic Stats. Who is going to enforce the speed limit. I believe that the main problems on the roads in West Bridgford come from parked cars on corners or obstructing pavements and when are we actually going to tackle every parents nightmare of heavy volume of traffic and bad parking around schools.
Please don’t get me wrong but just because something seems to be a good idea doesn’t mean it is, look at the bigger picture first. It’s the same as Radcliffe Road through West Bridgford, lowering the speed limit to 30mph will cause mayhem on Meadow Lane and Lady Bay Bridge.
Which roads would be 20mph would main artierial roads be included such as Musters, Melton, Bridgford and Loughborough Roads plus many more I could mention.Who would decide? How much would this cost. Would all resident be consulted or would it be decided by the whim of a few.
When you get time drive through West Bridgford using all different types of roads but drive at 20mph or as they say just under to be safe then decide if this a good idea or even necessary.
Sorry to go on but I don’t think a blanket 20mph limit is necessary and please don’t even consider speed bumps!!!!
